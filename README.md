# getMemriseCourse
Grab a Memrise course by ID and save all words of every level into a text file

This works for Python 2.7 and probably also on Python 3 (update Print statement) and requires the following packages:

Requests, lxml, BeautifulSoup

Simply use the get_course function in the download_Memrise.py file with a valid Memrise course ID.
